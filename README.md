# Basic instructions to run the notebook allExperiments

You can install all dependencies to your machine using the **dependencies.ipynb** notebook, if you use this then you don't have to execute the first cell in **allExperiments.ipynb**. \
Once this is done, you can run the cells in the main notebook and execute the experiments at will.\
Bear in mind that all the cells for a given experiment should be executed in isolation, as some variables are overwritten across experiments.
